## Development

This implementation is a development of **Jan Machaček**, **Leonardo José Cocco** and
**Marcin Cudny**, developed for and derived from the free finite-element software
<a href="https://www.numgeo.de/" target="_blank">numgeo</a>.

- **Leonardo José Cocco** provided the original Fortran UMAT implementation of the base Hardening Soil model (Cocco &amp; Ruiz 2018), which was modernized, refactored and optimized for the integration into numgeo as the base Hardening-Soil-MN model.
- **Marcin Cudny** kindly provided some base subroutines for the BRICK string properties and brick-movement mechanism (following Cudny &amp; Truty 2020), which were refactored in the same style and integrated into numgeo as the small-strain stiffness extension documented here.
- **Jan Machaček** is the developer and maintainer of numgeo and of this repository, and modernized, optimized both contributions for the integration into numgeo, the constitutive module, the incremental-driver wrapper, the calibration tool and the UMAT interface shipped here.

### The software
numgeo is a free finite-element framework for geotechnical engineering. The constitutive module shipped in this repository is developed for, and extracted from, numgeo. <br>

### Using the model directly in numgeo
If you are already working in numgeo, the most convenient way to use the Hardening-Soil-MN-Bricks
model is directly through numgeo itself, where material-parameter input, state-variable
initialisation and output requests all follow the documented numgeo conventions. This repository
exists for users who specifically want the constitutive routine outside numgeo — in Abaqus, or in
a standalone element-test driver. <br>
